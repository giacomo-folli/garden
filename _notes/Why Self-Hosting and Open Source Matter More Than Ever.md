In today’s Internet everything you do online can be tracked, stored and monetized.
Free apps, smart devices, AI assistants —[^1] they all come with a hidden cost: _your data_. Even the platforms you trust most are constantly harvesting information under the guise of “personalization” or “improving user experience.”  
The explosion of AI has only made things worse. Privacy policies are bloated legal shields, and regulation is still stuck in the 2010s.

_So yeah, in 2025, digital privacy is… tricky._ But lately there’s a simple and alternative way that’s becoming more and more popular.

## The Case for Open Source and Self-Hosting

Open source software flips the script.  
It’s transparent, community-driven, and most importantly, it doesn’t need your data to survive. There are no black boxes. No shady telemetry. No sneaky “opt-out” checkboxes hidden deep in settings.

Self-hosting takes this one step further —[^2] it puts you in the driver’s seat.  
You run your own services on your own hardware or a trusted cloud.

No middlemen. Just you and your machine.

## Not Just for Hackers Anymore

Self-hosting used to be a niche hobby for sysadmins, coders or command-line cowboys, but in 2025 the game has changed dramatically.

Platforms like **CasaOS** have made it insanely simple to set up your own services and providers like **Hetzer** give you basic tier servers for less than 5$ a month.

Chances are, most of what you do with Google or Microsoft can be replaced today.

- For **notes**, try _Joplin Server_ or _Standard Notes_
- For **file sync**, _Nextcloud_ is a beast (and only getting better)
- Want to ditch **Google Calendar**? Use _Radicale_ or _Baïkal_
- Replace your **password manager** with _Bitwarden_, self-hosted and secure
- Follow **news** with _FreshRSS_ or _Miniflux_... no algorithm in sight
- Even **chat**? _Matrix_ is the decentralized future Slack doesn’t want you to know about[^3]

The ecosystem is rich, modern, and surprisingly stable.  
And every service you host is one less point of surveillance in your life.

## The Big Picture

Self-hosting won’t fix everything. But it _will_ give you a piece of the internet that’s actually yours. You don’t need to be a developer or a Linux guru.
Just curious, a bit patient, and maybe willing to repurpose an old laptop or Raspberry Pi.

In 2025, digital privacy isn’t dead.

It’s becoming _a movement_.
