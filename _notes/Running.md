This week I ran a total of 16km, 10km on Tuesday and 6km yesterday evening. Maybe on Saturday I'll finish with 26/28km, the best would be 30km but only because it's a round number.
In truth, the last few months have been similar, and I can finally say that this is the first time I've been able to maintain this pace for more than three months in a row (including Christmas and New Year's Eve). So I wanted to write down a few thoughts.

Lately, I've realized that running is helping me with a fairly widespread problem in my daily life, namely learning to put things into perspective or, in other words, knowing how to give the right weight to what happens to me.

I often found myself with a lot of thoughts focused on something that was weighing on me and I couldn't calm down completely, couldn't get them out of my mind. At the same time, I realized that a short run, not even too long, solved most of the noise.

Running is a time to disconnect. I stop thinking about the fact that I'm behind in my studies or have problems at work or whatever else and focus on the present, on putting one foot in front of the other and controlling my breathing. And this helps me a lot, because it reminds me that there is a world of other things that continue to exist even if something goes wrong.

Running is another commitment, another challenge, another test that I can train for, knowing that the result depends entirely on me and me alone.

Other observations about my runs:\
\- My left knee often hurts\
\- I generally sleep better the days after\
\- Very tiring and not improving\
\- Runner's high is like cannabis but more concentrated\
