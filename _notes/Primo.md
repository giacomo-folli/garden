Hi, I'm paco and I'm really glad to meet you :)
I'm a IT Engineering student at UniPr in Italy and a part-time full stack developer at a local company.
I like running, exploring the italian countryside/mountains and playing as many instruments I can get my hands on.

Lately I searched for a place on the web to collect my thoughts and develop them in a sustainable way (without the rush to fight any algorithm). I came around these two posts that made me appreciate the _Digital Garden_ philososphy:

- [https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)
- [https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)[^1]
- [https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/](https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/)

They are not all directly related to the subject, but they still made me develop some interest in the same approach: to take things slowly, show up, create value and do it in a fun and sustainable way - far from feeds/algorithms/advertisment/etc...

If you're still reading I suggest you check those articles out. They deserve all the praise!

Sooo here we are, this is my first note on my digital garden. It's a work in progress, today I forked [this jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) and setup the project with Netlify automatic deploy via Github. I made some improvements and now I have to populate this.

For now it's a pretty empty garden...
